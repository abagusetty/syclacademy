# SYCL Academy

## Exercise 1: Compiling with SYCL

---

For this first exercise you simply need to register and log in to the DevCloud 
environment. We would recommend accessing the DevCloud through the Jupyter terminal.
To access this go to [this page](https://devcloud.intel.com/oneapi/get_started/) 
and scroll right to the bottom where there is a link "Connect with Jupyter* Lab."
Once opened, which may take a little time, use the "File->New->Terminal" option to 
open a console.

### 2.) Verifying your environment

Depending on the SYCL implementation used, the steps to verify your environment might vary.

#### DPC++

```
sycl-ls
```

This will show you the devices that are available to you on the system.

### 3.) Configuring the exercise project

Once you have confirmed your environment is setup and available you are ready to
compile your first SYCL application from source code.

First fetch the tutorial samples from GitHub.

If you have not done so already clone this repository ensuring that you include sub-modules 
and the "isc22" branch.

```
git clone --recursive --branch isc22 https://github.com/codeplaysoftware/syclacademy.git
```

### 4.) Include the SYCL header file

Then open the source file for this exercise and include the SYCL header file
`"sycl/sycl.hpp"`.

Make sure before you do this you define `SYCL_LANGUAGE_VERSION` to `2020`, to
enable support for the SYCL 2020 interface.

Once that is done build your source file with your chosen build system.

### 5.) Compile and run

Once you've done that simply build the exercise with your chosen build system
and invoke the executable.


#### Build And Execution Hints Using the DevCloud

First navigate the terminal to the right directory:

```
cd syclacademy/Code_Exercises/Exercise_01_Compiling_with_SYCL
```

For For DPC++ this is how you would compile your source code:

```sh
icpx -fsycl -o sycl-ex-1 source.cpp
```

Then run the compiled binary using

```
./sycl-ex-1
```

In Intel DevCloud, to run computational applications, you will submit jobs to a queue for execution on compute nodes,
especially some features like longer walltime and multi-node computation is only abvailable through the job queue.

We have provided a ready made script in the same directory as the source.cpp file, so you can call:

```sh
./q run.sh
```

To compile the `solution.cpp` file you will need to update the run.sh file.
